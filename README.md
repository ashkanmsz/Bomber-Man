# bomber-man
This is a simple implementation of the Bomber Man game which was the final project of my advanced programming course.

# Features:
1. In this game, you have to kill the enemies with your bombs.
1. There is a timer that you should kill all of them in time.
1. There would be some rewards to raise your bomb's power or give you extra heart for surviving.
1. You can make a profile for yourself and even see your highest scores.
